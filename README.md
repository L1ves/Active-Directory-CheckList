# Active-Directory-CheckList

A repo for documents containing curated list of health and (in the future security) checks to be run against a Windows Active-Directory domain.

## Why

There are many blog posts around the internet containing (more or less) usefull information about Active Directory.  
There are Microsoft Docs with very detailed description of all services and dependancies for AD and DCs as well.  
There are also some repositories, modules and scripts to perform checks against DCs.  
This repository with lists included aim to gather `raw` knowledge of what it means that AD is healthy, operating properly and configured with best practices.  

> This can help others write the tool they need

This open list should help others write or perform tests they need in a tool they choose.
