# Active-Directory-CheckList

A repo for documents containing a curated list of health and (in the future) security checks to be run against a Windows Active-Directory domain.

## Why

There are many blog posts on the internet containing (more or less) useful information about Active Directory.  
There are Microsoft Docs with very detailed descriptions of all services and dependencies for AD and DCs as well.  
There are also some repositories, modules, and scripts to perform checks against DCs.  
This repository with lists included aims to gather `raw` knowledge of what it means that AD is healthy, operating properly, and configured using best practices.

> This can help others write the tool they need

This open list should help others write or perform the tests they need in a tool they choose.
